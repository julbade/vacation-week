      <h2>Welcome to Paris!</h2>

      <h3> Daytime</h3>

      <p class="paragraph">Paris’ landmarks and attractions are so iconic, chances are, you already have a good idea of what you want to see. Spend your first day getting your bearings in the city and ticking off those top sights. The city’s must-see attractions are scattered across the centre of Paris, so the best way to get from one to the other is by taking a hop-on hop-off bus tour, with the option of getting off at the major sights.
        Start at the big one - the <b><a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/">Eiffel Tower</a></b>. You literally can’t miss it, so you might as well make it your first port of call and beat the crowds. It’s an amazing sight from the ground, but if you want to get a closer look, there are plenty of ways to explore. The first floor has a glass floor you can walk across, and exhibitions detailing the history of the tower. The second floor has a viewing gallery with telescopes plus souvenir shops and restaurants. The third floor is the highest point – take the lift straight up to the top and you’ll get vertigo-inducing views across the whole city. There’s also a champagne bar up there for a romantic touch. </p>

        <h3>Night Time</h3>
        <img src="../img/Boullian.jpg" id="boullian">

        <p class="paragraph">Paris is one of the best cities in the world for food, with over 70 Michelin-starred restaurants to dine in, plus a huge variety of chic cafes, bistros and wine bars. If you’re after gastronomic excellence, pick Restaurant Guy Savoy for oysters and sumptuous seafood, or L’Orangerie for Michelin-starred masterpieces. Or, if you want to visit a traditional French brasserie and mingle with the locals, pick the lively and popular <b><a href="https://www.bouillon-chartier.com/en/">Boullian Chartier</a></b> restaurant. This place is over 100 years old and offers traditional dishes (yep – that includes snails) at great prices.</p>

        <h3>Shows</h3>
        <img src="../img/moulin.jpg" id="moulin">
      <p class="paragraph">After your culinary feast, why not treat yourself to a traditional Parisian cabaret? The <b><a href="http://www.moulinrouge.fr/">Moulin Rouge</a></b> is the most famous show – make sure you book your tickets in advance to get good seats. There’s also Le Zebre de Belleville, which is a contemporary version of the traditional cabaret, and Crazy Horse, an artsy, burlesque show.
      Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site, the can-can dance revue evolved into a form of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of cabarets across Europe.</p>
